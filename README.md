## Project Experience

### E-Sports Data Web Scraper and Modeling (Python/R)
**August 2024**

- Developed a web scraping script to gather updated match data using Python and implemented a data pipeline to prepare the data for predictive analysis.
- Engineered features using existing data to improve model accuracy for binary classification by 10%.
- **Key Focus:** Gathered and transformed raw match data to improve the accuracy of match outcome predictions, implementing feature engineering techniques that led to a significant increase in model accuracy and enhanced decision-making.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Simulation (Python)
**November 2024**

- Used Monte Carlo simulation to generate datasets of randomly played Tic-Tac-Toe games, then trained a random forest model to see how often a bot would play a perfect game at various training set sizes.
- Observed that as the dataset size increased, perfect-game rate rose in a pattern similar to a “with replacement” sampling curve.
- **Key Focus:** Demonstrated strong data simulation skills and the ability to derive practical solutions.
